## Notes made while learning more about Heap (https://azeria-labs.com/)

#### Memory Chunks:

Whenever someone demands for space in heap (let' say 20bytes), heap managers returns a pointer to some address which is slightly more in size
then 20 bytes as it needs to store other metadata. Then the Heap Manager marks this chunk **Allocated**.

#### CHUNK ALLOCATION:

* If there is some previously freed chunk which is fullfills the demands of the programmer, then the heap manager will use that chuck for the new allocation.
* If there is space available at the top of the heap (higher address) then the heap manager will allocate that space.
* If there is no space left at the top of the heap then the heap manager would ask kernel to add at the end of the heap and then allocate the new chunk.
* If none of them worked then the result would be null.

#### Allocation from free'd chunks:

If some chunk if free'd from the process then heap manager track them in linked lists called **bins**. When a new allocation request is made then heap managers searches these bins
for the chunk which fulfills the demands and marks it allocated.

#### Allocation from top of the stack:

If there is no free'd space that can service our needs then the heap manager looks at the top of the heap if there is space available and
if found then the heap manager allocates the space to the chunk.

#### Asking Kernel for more memory:

Once the initial heap is all covered up, heap manager would ask kernel to add more memory at the end of the heap.On the initial heap, the heap manager asks the kernel to allocate more memory at the end of the heap by calling sbrk. On most Linux-based systems this function internally uses a system call called “brk”. As the system call is made by the heap manager, it would allocate more memory at the end of the initial heap.

Calls made to brk can sometimes fail as the heap can grow so large that it can collide with other memory mapping such as shared library, function stacks. Once the heap reaches this point, the heap manager will resort to attaching new non-contiguous memory to the initial program heap using calls to mmap.

#### Off Heap allocation (MMAP):

When large allocation requests are encountered, then the allocation is done off-heap using call to mmap. When these chunks are passed to free then the memory is returned to system.

*By default this threshold is 128KB up to 512KB on 32-bit systems and 32MB on 64-bit systems, however this threshold can also dynamically increase if the heap manager detects that these large allocations are being used transiently.*

#### Arenas:

On multithreaded applications, the heap manager requires secondary location for such threads which are known as arenas. Each arena is entirely different heap and manages it own bins and chunk allocation separately.

With each new thread that joins the process, the heap manager tries to find an arena that no other thread is using and attaches the arena to that thread. Once all available arenas are in use by other threads, the heap manager creates a new one, up to the maximum number of arenas of 2x cpu-cores in 32-bit processes and 8x cpu-cores in 64-bit processes. Once that limit is finally reached, the heap manager gives up and multiple threads will have to share an arena and run the risk that performing heap operations will require one of those threads to wait for the other.
