## Notes made while learning more about Heap (https://azeria-labs.com/)

#### Memory Chunks:

Whenever someone demands for space in heap (let' say 20bytes), heap managers returns a pointer to some address which is slightly more in size
then 20 bytes as it needs to store other metadata. Then the Heap Manager marks this chunk **Allocated**.

#### CHUNK ALLOCATION:

* If there is some previously freed chunk which is fullfills the demands of the programmer, then the heap manager will use that chuck for the new allocation.
* If there is space available at the top of the heap (higher address) then the heap manager will allocate that space.
* If there is no space left at the top of the heap then the heap manager would ask kernel to add at the end of the heap and then allocate the new chunk.
* If none of them worked then the result would be null.

#### Allocation from free'd chunks

If some chunk if free'd from the process then heap manager track them in linked lists called **bins**. When a new allocation request is made then heap managers searches these bins
for the chunk which fulfills the demands and marks it allocated.

#### Allocation from top of the stack

If there is no free'd space that can service our needs then the heap manager looks at the top of the heap if there is space available and
if found then the heap manager allocates the space to the chunk.

#### Asking Kernel for more memory
