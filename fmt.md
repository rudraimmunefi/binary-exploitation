## Everything I learned about FMT in general

Not-So vulnerable code:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	char a[100];
	puts("Enter your name:");
	scanf("%s",a);
	printf("%s",a);
	puts("\nbye");
	return 0;
}
```

Vulnerable Code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	char a[100];
	puts("Enter your name:");
	scanf("%s",a);
	printf(a);
	puts("\nbye");
	return 0;
}
```
The major difference between the two code is passing of user input directly into the printf function.Variable *a* is passed to printf which is a user input and it can't be trusted and if passed with some format strings then the value from the stack would be leaked to the user.
