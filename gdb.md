* Listing information about a process running - info proc map
* Printing address of commands such as system - p system
* Not really gdb but is useful for finding offset of functions/strings in libc - strings -a -t x /libc/libc-2.xxxx.so | grep "/bin/sh"
* Loading symbols from a binary to find locations - objdump -t binary and also &target where target is a variable in the binary.
* Use **dmesg** to check the crash logs
* To find the offset we can use pwntools **pwn cyclic 50** and **pwn cyclic -l [address]**
* Examine the dump core file with gdb use **coredumpctl gdb [seg int number]** and use **context** command to forward into the crash point in gdb.
* **info var** to dump all the variables in the binary.
* Another trick for finding offsets -> readelf -s libpivot32.so | grep funcname
* Finding base offsets:
```
# Calculating the addresses is achieved like:
#
# lib_base  = foot_leak - foot_offset
# ret2_addr = p32(lib_base + ret2_offset)
```
* Useful in ret2csu **disassemble __libc_csu_init**, **disas _fini**, **x/10g &_DYNAMIC**

* Pwndb -
  * vmmap - visual mapping of memory
  * vis - inspect heap memory
  * u - deference insturction present of an address
