* Listing information about a process running - info proc map
* Printing address of commands such as system - p system
* Not really gdb but is useful for finding offset of functions/strings in libc - strings -a -t x /libc/libc-2.xxxx.so | grep "/bin/sh"
* Loading symbols from a binary to find locations - objdump -t binary and also &target where target is a variable in the binary.
* Use **dmesg** to check the crash logs
* To find the offset we can use pwntools **pwn cyclic 50** and **pwn cyclic -l [address]**
